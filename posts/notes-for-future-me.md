I've tried every note-taking system. Zettelkasten, PARA, plain folders, a single giant file. The one I've stuck with is embarrassingly simple, and it works because of one rule: every note has to be useful to me six months from now with no additional context.

## The template

```
# [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Tags: tag1, tag2

## What is this?
One or two sentences. What prompted this note?

## The thing itself
The actual content — code, idea, decision, reference.

## Why it matters
What would I lose if I deleted this?

## Next (optional)
Anything actionable, or leave blank.
```

## Why it works

The "Why it matters" section is the one I resisted longest. It feels redundant when you're writing the note. It's invaluable when you're reading it. It forces you to articulate the value of the thing you're capturing, which either confirms it's worth keeping or reveals it isn't.

The "Next" section being optional matters too. Not everything needs an action. Most notes are just reference. Forcing an action onto a reference note is how you create a task list you never actually work from.

That's the whole system. It fits in a README. It works in any editor. It doesn't require a subscription.
