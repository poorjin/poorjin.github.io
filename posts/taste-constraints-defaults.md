I used to think taste was something you either had or didn't. A mysterious quality, distributed unevenly, that explained why some people's work looked effortless and mine looked like I was trying too hard.

I no longer think this.

## Taste is a set of constraints

When I look at work I admire — writing, software, interfaces — what I'm actually looking at is a set of decisions that are consistent with each other. The author picked a lane and stayed in it. The product said no to features. The essay didn't try to cover everything.

Taste is mostly knowing what to leave out.

## Good defaults reduce decision fatigue

The reason systems like Tailwind or Rails succeeded isn't that they're technically superior. It's that they give you good defaults and ask you to override them deliberately. You spend your decisions on the things that matter to your specific problem, not on the things that are the same for every project.

This is a good model for almost any creative work. Establish your defaults early. Make exceptions intentionally. Revisit the defaults when the exceptions accumulate.

## Constraints as creative tools

My best writing has always come from artificial constraints. A word limit. A single example. A rule that I can't use jargon. These aren't restrictions — they're the thing that makes the work possible, because they reduce the search space to something navigable.

Unconstrained, I can go anywhere. Which means I often go nowhere.
