Curabitur pretium tincidunt lacus. Nulla gravida orci a odio, et tempus feugiat. Nullam varius turpis ut ligula eleifend, vel sagittis nunc ultrices.

## Pellentesque habitant

Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante.

Donec eu libero sit amet quam egestas semper. *Aenean ultricies mi vitae est.* **Mauris placerat eleifend leo.** Quisque sit amet est et sapien ullamcorper pharetra.


I have a folder on my desktop called *slow*. It holds projects that have no deadline, no audience, and no obvious purpose beyond the fact that I keep returning to them. A small interpreter. A note-taking tool I'll probably never finish. A half-written essay about maps.

For a long time I was embarrassed by this folder. Productivity culture has a name for it: scope creep, yak shaving, distraction. The advice is always the same — ship early, ship often, validate fast.

## The case for the long arc

But I've noticed something. The projects in that folder are the ones that have taught me the most. Not because they're complex, but because returning to them after weeks away forces a kind of archaeology. You read your own code like a stranger. You ask: *why did I do it this way?* And sometimes the answer is embarrassing, and sometimes it's surprisingly good.

> The work that nobody sees is often the work that shapes how you do everything else.

This isn't a defense of never shipping. It's a defense of the projects that exist outside the shipping cycle — the ones you do because you're curious, and because curiosity, unlike motivation, doesn't require an audience.

## What slow work actually looks like

It looks like opening a file, reading for ten minutes, closing it. It looks like a commit with the message `not sure about this`. It looks like leaving a TODO that you'll resolve in three months when you finally understand what you were trying to say.

It is, in other words, indistinguishable from procrastination from the outside. The difference is that you keep coming back.

And that, I think, is enough.
